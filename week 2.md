## Week 2 - Case study - Agile and Scrum

---

### Task 1

---

#### 1a. Identify from the observations, where all would you think Service Inc. did not meet the intent of the Agile Manifesto

1. The inputs taken from customers was quite limited as the team had taken over most of the planning. This is in contrast to Agile where customer interaction is greatly valued.

2. The company was more invested in the financial prospect ie signing a deal over understanding and responding to the customers' needs

3. Quality of the product was compromised as its development took place with only completion of the project in mind.

4. Their development plans were predefined and rigid, and the backlogs were not updated regularly as they lacked customer input.

#### 1b. Identify from the observations, where all would you think Service Inc. deviated from what is expected from a SCRUM implementation

1. Customer feedback was not prioritised and the opinions of the development team were considered more important.

2. The development plans were rigid and not updated as the development progressed.

3. Developers were given roles without any prior training.

#### 1c. Discuss each of the findings in the table and indicate whether the finding contributed positively or negatively in go/no go recommendation and indicate with ~5 sentences why it is so

Stan had assessed every facet of Agile-SCRUM that was meant to be implemented at Service Inc. He found that the key aspect of customer communication, which is the backbone of the Agile manifesto, was clearly missing from their processes across all centres. The only consistency he found was in daily SCRUM meetings, which were fruitless given the lack of flexibility in their development plans. This caused Stan to issue a no-go decision.

#### 2. How can Service Inc. achieve 40% growth in margin while achieving only a 25% growth in revenue?

Service Inc can achieve significant growth by increasing customer-developer interactions and focusing on the customers' point of view while developing their products in the future. A customer centric product will definitely provide a boost in the market. They can also expand their domain and create products for individual use as opposed to corporate use and explore a new market.

#### 3. What are the cultural differences between Service Inc. and Product Inc. that you think is a challenge for successful SCRUM implementation that would satisfy Product Inc.?

Product Inc. is a flat organization with open offices, where engineers and managers Including VPs and SVPs share open cubicles, with the senior managers having offices in corners where engineers do not need to go often, and are designed with dedicated conference rooms for meetings. On the contrary, in Service Inc., one can make out the seniority of a manager in the organization by the size of his desk and room that he has been allocated. Product Inc. has been a client of Service Inc. , and is more focused on the financial aspect of the project whereas Service Inc. is more concerned about production. The difference in work culture could come across as negative to either of the companies during the development process.
